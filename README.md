TRON License
============

Version 0.1, April 2015

https://github.com/OAuth3/TRON-LICENSE

I don't have time for all the legal mumbo jumbo right now, but suffice it to say that
the world needs a social contract for the upcoming nexternet, the peer web.

For that reason, the software you're using is protected by the TRON License
(no relation to Disney).

In essense, in order to use this software, you **must** agree to fight for the users.

You agree to fight for
  * the users
  * the users' privacy
  * the users' bandwidth
  * security of the users' data

Where 'fight for' means 'actively do all within your technical capacity to serve and protect'.

Big Picture (Draft)
===========

For every user of your system or connected systems:

  * You may store data on the user's own machine
  * You will not take or attempt to take any data that you were not explicitly granted access to
  * You will not store user data on "disk" unless the user has granted permission to do so
  * You will not store user data in "cache" for longer than your token is active

In general, you should

  * Act in the interest of the individual users and developers of the systems
  * Do not ever act in the interest of corporations, governments, etc when that is in conflict with the interest of the users.
  * Don't be evil, unethical, unsavory, or mean
  * Don't do anything with users' data or resources that they wouldn't expect
    * (i.e. you tell them you will notify them on important updates, but then also send ads)
      * "important new announcement: now xyz only $5 per month"
    * (i.e. you post automatically in the user's behalf to promote your brand)
      * "so and so" is using "super app" to do "mundane thing"
  * You won't spam users or systems

TODO Sections
=============

  * General Practices for running software on the user's device(s)
  * General Practices for running software on your own services in the user's behalf
  * General Practices for ethically doing your business (because hey, software isn't free) while protecting the users

And Always Remember
===================


"Handling user requests is what computers are for",
not "doing our business is what computers are for"
